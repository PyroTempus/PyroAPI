# PyroAPI

**PyroAPI** is the centralized, standalone API for all plugins in the **Pyro** series. This library allows developers to easily interact with multiple Pyro plugins without needing to rely on internal classes from each plugin individually.

---

## âœ… Supported Plugins & Versions

This API currently supports the following plugins and their minimum required versions:

- **PyroFishingPro** `v4.10.0+`
- **PyroMining** `v5.0.0+`
- **PyroWeatherPro** `v5.0.0+`
- **PyroFarming** `v1.3.0+`

> ðŸ”¥ Note: The API will be officially released alongside **PyroFishingPro v4.10.0**.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Purpose

Starting with this release, **all API methods will be removed from the individual premium plugin jars**. Instead, this external API library will be the **only dependency required** to interact with the APIs of any supported Pyro plugin.

This makes development and support cleaner, more consistent, and easier to maintain.

## ðŸ’¬ Feature Requests

Iâ€™m open to suggestions for new features or expanded support. While these are not a top development priority, Iâ€™m happy to consider any requests made via my **[Discord server](https://your-discord-invite-link-here)**.

## ðŸ“š Getting Started

To use this API in your project:

1. **Download** the latest `PyroAPI` release from the GitHub [Releases](../../releases) section.
2. **Add it as a dependency** in your plugin project.
3. Make sure the required plugins are installed on the server with the correct versions (listed above).

Example usage:

```java
Plugin pyroFishing = getServer().getPluginManager().getPlugin("PyroFishingPro");
if (pyroFishing != null) {
    // Safe to call PyroAPI methods
}
